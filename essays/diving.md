Throughout the years many things have evolved and begun to change their meaning in our society. This includes software engineering and its contribution to the tech industry. From being able to give people seamless websites with minimal flaws so they can shop and be entertained, to useful programs that make the daily tasks in life easier. Software engineering is at the forefront of innovation in our world today. It is a dynamic field that has captivated my interest due to its ability to continuously impact the future. One of the many topics of software engineering that catches my attention is quantum computing. Even though quantum computing is a topic way beyond my technological skills, the ideas and implications it proposes to the world are extremely fascinating. The ability to change many fields in our lives like medicine, cybersecurity, and a couple more, I believe it to be one of the many fields of software engineering to have a heavy impact in our lives moving forward.


In addition to the theoretical and technical aspects of software engineering, I am also deeply interested in the creative possibilities it offers. One of the many examples would be video game development. The ability for people to create an entire world filled with new characters and scenarios is something to be impressed with. Video games of all scales take a lot of work and careful attention to detail to perfect. Video games are a medium in which complex ideas and emotions can be conveyed to a larger audience, and as someone interested in the field of software engineering, I am also amazed at the ability of people to overcome the many challenges in crafting an interactive experience. 

Along with being able to create creative stories and impact the future, software engineering has improved our day-to-day lives. From the ability to order food and checkout at a grocery store, to being able to now write small-scale applications with the use of AI. Software engineering has made it possible for people to craft solutions that are not only entertaining but also add tangible value to peopleâ€™s lives. This can be shown through the ability of people to create their own websites to sell clothing and products. The ability to create and communicate has been greatly enhanced by software engineering.

My hope in software engineering is to be able to hone my skills to become a full-stack developer. I wish to be able to create both the front end and back end of websites, giving me the ability to help people who wish to pursue their want in being an entrepreneur and providing a product or service to others. Along with that, I want to be able to improve my problem-solving skills which can be used to solve problems beyond software engineering.
